/**
 * You have three challenges to solve below with Vanilla JavaScript.

/**
 * Challenge 1: Alert Me
 * When the clicks on the button that says "Alert Me!", it should display an alert.
 * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert
 */
 const alertMe = document.querySelector('.btn-success');
 alertMe.addEventListener("click", ()=>{
   alert("Alert Me!");
 });
/**
 * Challenge 2: Disable a button that will charge a credit card.
 *
 * To prevent users from charging the credit card more than once:
 * 1. Disable the button when it is clicked.
 * 2. Change the text to say e.g. "Loading ..." once it is clicked.
 */

const button = document.querySelector('.btn-warning');

const disableBtn = () => {
  button.disabled = 'disabled';
  button.textContent = 'Loading ...';
};

button.addEventListener('click', disableBtn);

/**
 * Challenge 3: Show comments for the news story.
 *
 * When the user clicks on the "View Comments" button, the comment section should appear.
 * Right now, the comments are hidden because they have the class ".hidden",
 * but you can switch up the HTML so that it uses inline styles if you like.
 *
 * BONUS: Clicking on the button should toggle instead of just show the comments.
 * If the comments are open, change the button text from "View Comments" to "Hide Comments".
 */

 const viewBtn = document.querySelector('.btn-primary');
 const viewCom = document.querySelector(".card-body");
 
 const comments = () => {
  if ( viewCom.style.display !== 'none' ) {
    viewCom.style.display = 'block';
    }
  };

 viewBtn.addEventListener('click', comments);


/**
 * Challenge 4: Rendering what a user is typing on the page.
 *
 * When the user types inside the textbook labeled "Enter mystery text here",
 * it should display what the user is typing in the <div></div> tags below.
 */

/**
 * Challenge 5: Display the results of the world's most pointless search engine.
 *
 * When the user types in the textbook and either clicks "Search" button or hits the enter key,
 * display the message "No results for ___ found" inside of this <p></p> below.
 * For example, if the user searches for "Indian Ocean", display "No results for Indian Ocean found".
 * (Since there are no oceans near Albany, NY, the search engine should
 * display the "No results for ___ found" message every time.)
 *
 * The exercise must be completed with a form handler
 * and you must prevent the page from refreshing when the form is submitted.
 */

/**
 * Challenge 6: Agree to the terms and conditions
 *
 * Whenever the user clicks the "Continue" button, if she has not agreed to the terms,
 * the error "You must agree to the terms and conditions" should appear
 * and the label "I Agree to the Terms and Conditions" should turn red.
 * If she has, then display "Thank you for signing up".
 *
 * To start, you will need to hide some element on the page and change the input's classes.
 */

/**
 * Challenge 7: Add pagination to the student table.
 *
 * First, when the page initially loads, only the first 10 students should be visible.
 * (That is, every student row that has data-group="1"). You can just use CSS / HTML to do this.
 *
 * Second, clicking on the pagination below should show and hide different students in the table:
 * - Clicking on the "«" and "1" buttons should show everything in data-group="1" and hide everything in data-group="2".
 * - Clicking on the "2" and "»" buttons should show everything in data-group="2" and hide everything in data-group="1".
